Good To Have - API Automation :
Background
Open Weather Map is free to use the website (and JSON API service) that can be used to query the
weather forecast of major cities around the
world. More information can be found here: http://openweathermap.org/forecast16
The Mission (Should you choose to accept it)
Is to implement a test to automate the following acceptance criteria (in the form of a BDD) in your tool
of choice/language
Scenario: A happy holidaymaker
Given I like to holiday in Sydney
And I only like to holiday on Thursdays
When I look up the weather forecast
Then I receive the weather forecast
And the temperature is warmer than 10 degrees

Assertions
The response is valid JSON and contains Sydney as a destination day of the weather forecast is
Thursday weather returned is &gt; 10 degrees C
Note: The emphasis is on the happy path (assume the service works and is secure) and more about
how you go about solving the problem and presenting your solution. Feel free to rewrite the problem
to your preference.
